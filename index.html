<h1>Jefferson's Rough Draft of the D of I</h1>
<ch2>Finding the sources that he used</h2>
<p>
  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, & destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation & tyranny already begun with circumstanccs of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

  <br><br>
  He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seasto bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends & brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.
  <br><br>
  He has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, & conditions of existence.
  <br><br>
  He has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow-citizens, with the allurements of forfeiture & confiscation of our property.
  <br><br>
  We therefore the representatives of the united States of America in General Congress assebled do in the name & by authority of the good people of these states reject and renounce all allegiance & subjections to the kings of Great Britain & all others who may hereafter claim by, through or under them: we utterly disolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us & the people or parliment of Great Britain: and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independent states, and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract allies, establish commerce, & do all other acts & things which independent states may of right do.
