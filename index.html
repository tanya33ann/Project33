<h1>Jefferson's Rough Draft of the D of I</h1>
<ch2>Finding the sources that he used</h2>
<p>
  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, & destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation & tyranny already begun with circumstanccs of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

  <br>
  He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seasto bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends & brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.
